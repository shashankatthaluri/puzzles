# Cow Division Solver 🐄📊
Welcome to the Cow Division Solver repository! 🎉🤠

## Introduction 🐮
Ever wondered how a milkman with 100 cows can fairly distribute the milk among his 10 sons? 🥛👨‍👦 This repository provides a logical and efficient solution to the problem, with a touch of mathematical flair.

## The Challenge 🤔
The milkman has 100 cows, each numbered from 1 to 100. Each cow produces milk equal to its number in liters. With 10 sons to share the bounty, the task is to divide the cows among them so that every son receives an equal amount of milk.

## The Solution 📈
The solution involves a pure logic-based approach, with an added touch of improvisation for general cases. The formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic progression, making it applicable to various scenarios.

## Arithmetic Progression Sum Formula:
Sum = n * (n + 1) / 2

In this case, the total quantity of milk obtained from 100 cows is calculated using the formula: Total Milk = 100 * (100 + 1) / 2 = 5050 liters.

The goal is to ensure that every son receives an equal amount of milk, i.e., 5050 / 10 = 505 liters.

## Pairing and Generalization 🤖
To achieve the fair distribution of cows, a pairing and generalization method is employed. By pairing the cows strategically, each son gets a pair that sums up to the desired quantity of milk. The formula for general cases is: n * (n + 1) / (2 * m) where n is the total number of cows, and m is the number of divisions.

For instance, if n = 10 and m = 5, the pairs would be distributed as follows:

Person 1: (1, 10)
Person 2: (2, 9)
Person 3: (3, 8)
Person 4: (4, 7)
Person 5: (5, 6)
which is easy. 
## Handling Remainders 🔄
In cases where the total cannot be divided perfectly, a round-wise distribution is performed. Any leftover pairs are summed up, and the total is divided among the sons. This ensures that each son receives a fair share, even with remainders.

Example:
For n = 17 and m = 5:

In the first round:

- Person a: (1, 17)
- Person b: (2, 16)
- Person c: (3, 15)
- Person d: (4, 14)
- Person e: (5, 13)

In the second round:
- Person a: (6, 12)
- Person b: (7, 11)
- Person c: (8, 10)
- Person d: 9
The remaining pairs (6, 12), (7, 11), (8, 10), and 9 are summed up (63), and the total is divided among the 5 sons. Each son receives an additional 12.6 liters, resulting in a fair distribution.
